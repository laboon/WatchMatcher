WatchMatcher 

Term Project for Bill Laboon, Machine Learning PhD Seminar, Fall 2011

Requires:
  * Perl
  * VLFeat
  * MATLAB
  * ImageMagick
  * iMacros (note: only works on Windows)
  * An OS which understands shell (.sh) scripts

NOTE:
   This is missing the iMacros code.  Looks like I archived it off somewhere.

   I will update when I can.  You could just use your own scraping solution, as long as the name of the image maps to the Amazon ID (ASIN).
